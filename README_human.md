# Transcriptomics Workflow

Instructions to take raw transcriptomics reads and progress to a counts file that can be used in `R` packages for statistical analysis of differential expression.

To follow this tutorial you will need to have some basic familiarity with working in a unix-like environment.  An excellent place to start would be to attend a [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) or [data carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshop, or complete the [Unix bootcamp](
http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=9xnbkx6eaof).  The VLSCI also have several tutorials for [working with unix and/or a HPC environment](http://vlsci.github.io/lscc_docs/tutorials/)

## Connect to Analysis Server
This will usually mean opening a terminal and using `ssh` to connect. The general format of this command is;

```bash
	ssh username@my.hpc.server.edu.au
```
## Adding Files into a HPC Terminal
To begin, navigate to the directory containing the files you want to upload to the server. A new terminal should appear on the screen.
The next step is to transfer the files from the new terminal into the HPC terminal. This step is completed using the 'secure copy' or `scp` command and is as follows:

```bash
	scp -r /path/to/the/data/ username@my.hpc.server.edu.au:~/
```

If you are unsure of the path to the data, use the `pwd` command in the terminal, as this will display the path to your current file/directory.
*Note the space either side of the `-r` and before the username*


*After downloading, it is a good idea to keep the original, unmodified files somewhere safe.*

#### Combining Data from Different Files
*Depending on the location of your files, you may not need to complete this step*
It may be the case that your data files are located in separate files within one directory \(my_directory\). Start by finding all of the required files by using the `find` command. This will ensure that you have all the correct files when you attempt to link them. The command is as follows:

```bash
	find path/to/files/ -name '*common.file.name'
```

The above command tells the cluster to find, within a particular directory, all the files that contain that particular name. You may wish to change the search to find all files that end with a particular file extension. If this is the case you would change '\*common.file.name' with '\*.file.extension'.

The output for this command will show a list of the files that contain the common name that you specified above.

### Creating a Loop to Link Files
A loop is a tool that enables you to execute a set of commands repeatedly.
This step uses the loop to take the original files and create a link with them into another directory. This allows one version of the files to be modified, while the originals remain untouched. The command for this is as follows:

```bash
	for f in `find path/to/files -name '*common.file.name'`; do ln -s $f .; done
```

This command says that for all the files listed in the step above, link them to the current directory.  
This creates a link between one directory \(i.e. the directory that contains the original files\) and your current directory \(indicated by the period.\) which allows you to access all the files in the original directory in your current directory, without changing anything about the original files.

This process is much more efficient than using the `cp` command to copy all the files into a new directory.

## Downloading the Human Genome
This step will be important when using the HISAT program to align the RNAseq reads onto the genome. This step will use the `wget` command, which allows the user to download particular files from the web. The general format of this command is:

```bash
	wget http://website.come/files
```
To download a version of the *human genome* with HiSat2 indexes, enter the following command into the terminal on HPC

```bash
	wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/hisat2/data/grch38.tar.gz
```

You also need to download a gene annotation file for transcript assembly. Using the same command above, download the following website file: ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-87/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf.gz

### Unpacking the Genome File
The human genome file and the annotation file given above are both compressed files and therefore need to be unpacked.  *This step will be different if you have downloaded a different version of the human genome*.
To unpack the version of the human genome given above, enter the command as follows:

```bash
	tar -zxvf grch38.tar.gz
```
To unpack the annotated file enter the command as follows:

```bash
	gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf.gz
```

### Building the Genome Index for HISAT2
Before continuing, the genome file downloaded above has to be built into an index which can be utilized by the HISAT2 program. In the folder \'grch38\', there is a file \'make_grch38.sh\', which is a built-in shell script that is used to build the genome index. Ensuring you're in the \'grch38\' directory, enter the command as follows:

```bash
 	./make_grch38
```

## Load the HISAT2 Program
This is done using the module command which can be used to load programs for use on the cluster. To load the HISAT2 program use the following command:

```bash
	module load hisat2
```

You may check that the program has been installed by entering:

```bash
	which hisat2
```

This should return a path showing the location to the hisat2 program.

Using this same process load the `samtools` program.

## Creating and Running the HISAT2 Script
When working with a large amount of files, it is not wise to submit them to the cluster in just one large job, as jobs with large resource requirements may take a long time to run.  A better way to make optimal use of cluster resources is to submit many smaller jobs. This requires that many separate job scripts are created. To do this we use a loop over all input files, modifying a template job script each time to insert the filename.

An example template HISAT2 script can be seen in the file labelled `01_HISAT.sh`.

Generally, any of the lines beginning with a `#` are comments and therefore ignored. However, when writing PBS scripts, there are exceptions. The script begins with `#!/bin/bash` or a \'shebang\', which simply indicates that the script is a bash script. The following lines that begin with `#PBS` are PBS directives and give the script information about how the job should be run. The script itself begins on line 18. This line tells the job to make `DUMMY` the variable for all files, as it may then be substituted for the name of a file, specified in the command line. The next command, on line 21, tells the job to navigate into a specific directory. By using an absolute directory, this step ensures that the relative pathways featured in the next command are correct and that the output files will be placed into the correct directory.

#### HISAT2 Command - Explained
Line 26 begins the actual hisat2 command and was modeled from the usage method \(which can be accessed by entering `hisat2` on the command line\). Firstly, it is important to specify the path to the hisat2 module as the script will not recognize if it has been previously loaded on the cluster. This path can be found by entering the command `which hisat2`. The `-p` command is an option which tells the hisat2 program how many CPUs it may use. The `-x` specifies the index and is followed by a path to the genome index, relative to the path specified on line 21. The `-U` may be substituted with a `-1` or a `-2` and specifies the type of file to be aligned; either unpaired `-U` or with paired ends `-1` and `-2`. The final section of this command line outputs the files to the samtools program as .sam files.

#### Samtools Command - Explained
The final line is a command which takes the sam output files from the previous command, sorts them and converts them to .bam files. The command begins by providing the path to the samtools program. The `sort` command tells samtools to sort the aligned data, produced by the hisat2 program. The other commands are a part of the samtools options, but are explained as follows: `-@` tells the program how many threads it may use when running; the `o` command tells samtools where to output the files \(as .bam files\).

### Running the Command Loop
For the above script to run through all the files efficiently, it needs to be put into a loop in the command line. To begin, the script needs to be downloaded to the cluster using the `scp` command \(In the \'Adding Files into a HPC Terminal\' above\). The command below was used to run the script 01_HISAT.sh and produces separate jobs for each file.

``` bash
	for f in *fastq.gz; do sed s/DUMMY/$f/ 01_HISAT.sh | qsub -; done
```

#### The Command Loop - Explained
The important commands in the above loop are `for f in _`, `do`, and `done`. A simplified way of stating this command is: *for* all of the files specified, *do* a particular command and, *done* - ends the loop. The particular command above states that for all the files ending in `fastq.gz`, do the `sed` command on the 01_HISAT.sh file and pipe the output to qsub. `sed` is a text editor that edits text in a non-interactive way, without altering the original text. The most common `sed` command is the substitution command or `s`. An example of this command is as follows: `sed s/old/new/ s_script.sh`, which searches the script called s_script.sh and replaces the text \'old\' with the text \'new\'. In the loop above, the sed command searches the 01_HISAT.sh text and substitutes the word \'DUMMY\' for the name of a file. The command line then pipes this command to qsub to submit the job to the cluster. The pipe command is very useful as it passes the output from one command (i.e. the sed command) to another (i.e. qsub). The loop ends with the command `done`, which indicates that the loop is finished. The loop then repeats, substituting a different file for DUMMY each time, until all the files have been submitted as jobs.
*The status of these jobs can be viewed by entering `qstat -u username` into the command line*.

After running this command, there should be 3 types of new files in your directory; .bam files, .sam files and hisat.o\* files. The hisat.o\* output files will show you the output from each alignment with each file and should give an overall alignment rate. The next step is to take the .bam files and run them through the stringtie program for transcript assembly.
